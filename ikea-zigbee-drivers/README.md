## Installation
There are two ways to install the drivers: using Hubitat Package Manager (HPM) or manually importing the driver code.

### HPM Installation (Recommended)
HPM is an app that allows you to easily install and update custom drivers and apps on your Hubitat hub. To use HPM, you need to have it installed on your hub first.

Once you have HPM installed, follow these steps to install the IKEA Zigbee drivers:

- In the Hubitat interface, go to **Apps** and select **Hubitat Package Manager**.
- Select **Install**, then **Search by Keywords**.
- Enter **IKEA Zigbee drivers** in the search box and click **Next**.
- Select **IKEA Zigbee drivers by Dan Danache** and click **Next**.
- Select the driver(s) you need from the dropdown list and follow the install instructions.

### Manual Installation
If you donâ€™t want to use HPM, you can also install the drivers manually by importing the driver code from GitHub. Follow these steps to do so:

- In the Hubitat interface, go to **Drivers Code**.
- Click **New Driver** in the top right, then click **Import** in the top right.
- Search below for your device, look for the **Manual install file** property and enter it in the URL field.
- Click **Import**, then click **OK** and the code should load in the editor.
- Click **Save** in the top right.

More info about installing custom drivers is available in the [Official Documentation](https://docs2.hubitat.com/en/how-to/install-custom-drivers).
