/*
Holding the PREV and NEXT buttons works in a weird way:

When PREV button is held, the following Zigbee messages are received:
#1. [12:55:35.429] description=[catchall: 0104 0005 01 01 0040 00 926B 01 01 117C 09 00 0000]

When PREV button is released, the following Zigbee message is received:
#5. [on release]   description=[catchall: 0104 0005 01 01 0040 00 926B 01 01 117C 09 00 XXXX]

When NEXT button is held, the following Zigbee messages are received:
#1. [12:56:59.463] description=[catchall: 0104 0005 01 01 0040 00 926B 01 01 117C 09 00 0000]

When NEXT button is released, the following Zigbee message is received:
#5. [on release]   description=[catchall: 0104 0005 01 01 0040 00 926B 01 01 117C 09 00 XXXX]

There is at least 2 seconds delay between the moment the device figured out that the button is held (not a click)
and the moment message #4 is received (the moment we can figure out what button was held (010D00 vs 000D00)).

IMHO, this weird behavior makes the use of the hold actions on the PREV and NEXT button unusable.
